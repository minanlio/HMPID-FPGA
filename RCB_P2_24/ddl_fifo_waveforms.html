<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file ddl_fifo.tdf </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design ddl_fifo.tdf. The design ddl_fifo.tdf has a depth of 1024 words of 32 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
